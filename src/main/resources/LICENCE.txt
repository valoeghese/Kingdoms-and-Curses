EULA
======

Terms:
- 'the mod' or 'this mod' refers to Kingdoms and Curses, by Valoeghese.
- 'addon' is any program that alters or interacts with the function of this mod.

You get the right to
- make deobfuscation mappings of the mod for the purpose of addons or education, so long as you do not profit from them.
- make addons to the mod that do not make profit, so long as you do not publicly share the source code of the mod. You may share autogenerated .patch files to avoid this (unless I deem it sharing the source code too much)
- make tools to interact with the mod
- play the mod
- stream and make youtube videos that are about or involve playing the mod
- share screenshots and gameplay of the mod

I explicitly reserve the right to
- change these terms at any point
